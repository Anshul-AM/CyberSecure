If you get that notification, take these actions: Report it Report the scam to local law enforcement, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at IC3.gov, and the FTC at FTC.gov/Complaint. Y ou also can forward phishing emails to spam@uce.gov (an address used by the FTC) and to reportphishing@apwg.org (an address used by the Anti-Phishing Working Group, which includes ISPs, security vendors, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies). Notify your customers If you find out scammers are impersonating your business, tell your customers as soon as possible — by mail, email, or social media. If you email your customers, send an email without hyperlinks: you don’t want your notification email to look like a phishing scam. Remind customers not to share any\n"

The medium of transport is often known as the vector of the virus.

The most important types of malware are described, together with their basic principles of operation and dissemination, and defenses against malware are discussed. 1 Some Deﬁnitions Malware is a general term for all types of malicious software, which in the context of computer security means: Software which is used with the aim of attempting to breach a computer system’s security policy with respect to Conﬁdentiality, Integrity or Availability. The term software should here be understood in the broadest sense, as the malicious eﬀect may make use of executable code, interpreted code, scripts, macros etc. The computer system whose security policy is attempted breached is usually known as the target for the malware.

MALWARE PROTECTION Implement technologies that detect and prevent the installation, execution, and transmission of malicious code on your network and information systems. Malware constitutes one of the top threats for network and information systems and the risks associated with its actions may vary: • Password theft, • Data theft, • Identification of additional targets within the network, • Unauthorized modification and encryption of data. Malicious code can infect systems in a variety of attack vectors, including email, malicious websites, and removable media (USB, external hard drives). Its propagation is based on vulnerabilities in the target systems but also on careless behavior of the end user, such as opening attachments and web links, installing software and inserting infected USB on PCs. For malware to be detected and removed, protection mechanisms must be applied to all input and output system points (workstations, web servers, mail servers, proxy'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NLP_Project/malware.pdf'}, page_content='The computer system whose security policy is attempted breached is usually known as the target for the malware. We shall use the term the initiator of the malware to denote the subject who originally launched the malware with the intent of attacking one or more targets. Depending on the type of malware, the set of targets may or may not be explictly known to the initiator. Note that this deﬁnition relates the malic iousness of the software to an attempted breach of the target’s security policy. This in turn means that it depends on the privileges of the initiator on the target system. A program P which would be classiﬁed as malware if initiated by an user with no special privileges, could easily be quite acceptable (though obviously a potential danger to have lying about) if executed by a system administrator with extensive privileges on the target system. 2 Classiﬁcation of Malware Malware is commonly divided into a number of classes, depending on the way in which it is introduced')]\n",

With this approach, it is usual for the virus code to be constructed so that the “original” code is executed after the virus code, as indicated in the examples of Figure 5. In this way, the executable appears to have the usual eﬀect and the user does not get suspicious. Directly changing the AddressOfEntryPoint ﬁeld is such an obvious idea that most an- tivirus systems check whether the beginning of the code is in a section which should not contain executable code or contains known patterns from a database of viral code. In an Entry Point Obscuring (EPO) virus, a more sophisticated technique is adopted in order to hide what is going on. Some possibilities, roughly in order of increasing complexity, are: • Insert a JUMP instruction somewhere in the executable’s code, to cause a jump to the start of the virus code. 6'), Document(metadata={'page': 7, 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NLP_Project/malware.pdf'}, page_content='imported functions, so that one of the entries in the table is replaced by the address of the start of the virus code. When the infected executable calls the relevant function, it starts the virus code instead. Once again, in order to prevent users becoming suspicious, the virus must call the original function once its own execution is completed. Detection of EPO vira is a challenge, as the inserted or modiﬁed JUMP or CALL instruc- tions can in principle be placed anywhere within the code. Searching through the ﬁle and checking all the JUMP and CALL instructions to see whether they activate viral code can be a slow process. The other eﬀective way to detect the presence of the virus is to emulate the execution of the program and see whether it would actually cause any damaging eﬀects. This is also slow, and can be fooled by a clever virus designer who includes random choices in the virus, so that it does not have a malicious eﬀect every time it is activated.

It is exactly this problem with EPO vira which has led to the development of antivirus systems which rely on detection of malicious behaviour rather than recognition of signatures. This approach will be dealt with in more detail in Section 6.3 below. A variant of the EPO approach is for the actual viral code to be kept in a library ﬁle (a shared library or a DLL) which the infected executable will call. The changes to the infected ﬁle can in this way be kept to a minimum: a pointer to the malicious library needs to be inserted in the import tables, and a CALL instruction must be inserted somewhere in the executable. This technique is used, for example, by the COK variant (2005) of the BackDoor virus (actually a Trojan horse) which deposits a DLL called spool.dll and then injects code into all processes running on')]\n",

A common arrangement is for the largest area of waste space to be used to contain a small loader which can load the remaining pieces of the virus code as required. One of the tests used for selecting the set of victim ﬁles would then typically be that they must contain a contiguous area of waste space which is large enough to hold the virus loader. Dividing the virus code up into small pieces also helps the virus designer to avoid his virus being detected, as the antivirus system will ﬁnd it diﬃcult to recognise a signature which is spread out over several regions of the ﬁle. 3.2 Executing the Virus Code The simplest way of ensuring that the virus code is executed is to change theAddressOfEn- tryPoint ﬁeld in the Optional Header, so that it points to the start of the virus code.

The most important types of malware are described, together with their basic principles of operation and dissemination, and defenses against malware are discussed. 1 Some Deﬁnitions Malware is a general term for all types of malicious software, which in the context of computer security means: Software which is used with the aim of attempting to breach a computer system’s security policy with respect to Conﬁdentiality, Integrity or Availability. The term software should here be understood in the broadest sense, as the malicious eﬀect may make use of executable code, interpreted code, scripts, macros etc. The computer system whose security policy is attempted breached is usually known as the target for the malware.

Then, by executing the appropriate commands, they exploit the vulnerabilities and can gain access to the system. In many cases the breach occurs due to vulnerable applications that were installed without the business need to do so. • In recent years, due to the improvement of mitigation measures for malware detection and blocking, attackers use a new and more sophisticated technique, the so-called fileless attacks . The term derives from the fact that in this case the malicious code runs directly in memory and does not create an executable file saved in the hard drive, so in most cases the antivirus cannot detect the attack. Most of these attacks start with a phishing email that seeks to lure the victim to open the attached file or click the link contained in the mail message. In the latter case, the victim is usually redirected to a fake webpage which mimics the legitimate one and asks for credentials. In the former case, when the user opens the'), Document(metadata={'page': 33, 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NLP_Project/Cybersecurity-Handbook-English-version.pdf'}, page_content='34 CYBERSECURITY HANDBOOK 7. MALWARE PROTECTION Implement technologies that detect and prevent the installation, execution, and transmission of malicious code on your network and information systems. Malware constitutes one of the top threats for network and information systems and the risks associated with its actions may vary: • Password theft, • Data theft, • Identification of additional targets within the network, • Unauthorized modification and encryption of data. Malicious code can infect systems in a variety of attack vectors, including email, malicious websites, and removable media (USB, external hard drives). Its propagation is based on vulnerabilities in the target systems but also on careless behavior of the end user, such as opening attachments and web links, installing software and inserting infected USB on PCs. For malware to be detected and removed, protection mechanisms must be applied to all input and output system points (workstations, web servers, mail servers, proxy')]\n",
