If you get that notification, take these actions: Report it Report the scam to local law enforcement, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at IC3.gov, and the FTC at FTC.gov/Complaint. Y ou also can forward phishing emails to spam@uce.gov (an address used by the FTC) and to reportphishing@apwg.org (an address used by the Anti-Phishing Working Group, which includes ISPs, security vendors, financial institutions, and law enforcement agencies). Notify your customers If you find out scammers are impersonating your business, tell your customers as soon as possible — by mail, email, or social media. If you email your customers, send an email without hyperlinks: you don’t want your notification email to look like a phishing scam. Remind customers not to share any\n"

The most important types of malware are described, together with their basic principles of operation and dissemination, and defenses against malware are discussed. 1 Some Deﬁnitions Malware is a general term for all types of malicious software, which in the context of computer security means: Software which is used with the aim of attempting to breach a computer system’s security policy with respect to Conﬁdentiality, Integrity or Availability. The term software should here be understood in the broadest sense, as the malicious eﬀect may make use of executable code, interpreted code, scripts, macros etc. The computer system whose security policy is attempted breached is usually known as the target for the malware.

MALWARE PROTECTION Implement technologies that detect and prevent the installation, execution, and transmission of malicious code on your network and information systems. Malware constitutes one of the top threats for network and information systems and the risks associated with its actions may vary: • Password theft, • Data theft, • Identification of additional targets within the network, • Unauthorized modification and encryption of data. Malicious code can infect systems in a variety of attack vectors, including email, malicious websites, and removable media (USB, external hard drives). Its propagation is based on vulnerabilities in the target systems but also on careless behavior of the end user, such as opening attachments and web links, installing software and inserting infected USB on PCs. For malware to be detected and removed, protection mechanisms must be applied to all input and output system points (workstations, web servers, mail servers, proxy'), Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NLP_Project/malware.pdf'}, page_content='The computer system whose security policy is attempted breached is usually known as the target for the malware. We shall use the term the initiator of the malware to denote the subject who originally launched the malware with the intent of attacking one or more targets. Depending on the type of malware, the set of targets may or may not be explictly known to the initiator. Note that this deﬁnition relates the malic iousness of the software to an attempted breach of the target’s security policy. This in turn means that it depends on the privileges of the initiator on the target system. A program P which would be classiﬁed as malware if initiated by an user with no special privileges, could easily be quite acceptable (though obviously a potential danger to have lying about) if executed by a system administrator with extensive privileges on the target system. 2 Classiﬁcation of Malware Malware is commonly divided into a number of classes, depending on the way in which it is introduced')]\n",

The two dominant techniques are encryption of the viral code and polymorphism. 3.3.1 Encryption Encryption of the viral code with diﬀerent encryption keys will produce diﬀerent cipher- texts, thus ensuring that a signature scanner cannot recognise the virus.

      "Polymorphic viruses are a type of malware that uses various techniques to change its code and evade detection by antivirus systems. The main idea behind polymorphism is to make the virus code look different each time it is executed, making it difficult for signature-based antivirus systems to recognize and detect it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymorphic viruses use different encryption keys, encryption algorithms, or other transformation techniques to alter their code. This makes it challenging for antivirus systems to create a signature for the virus, as the signature would need to account for all possible variations of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of polymorphic viruses on antivirus systems is significant. Signature-based antivirus systems, which rely on recognizing specific patterns or signatures in the virus code, are often ineffective against polymorphic viruses. This is because the virus code is constantly changing, making it difficult for the antivirus system to keep up with the latest variations.\n",

      "It is important for organizations to maintain an up-to-date inventory of hardware and software assets because it helps them to track their legally established resources, detect any unauthorized devices that have been connected to their network, and ensure that they have the required controls for the protection and maintenance of their assets. This is particularly crucial for larger organizations with a constantly changing environment, including mobile devices and teleworking. Without an up-to-date inventory, organizations may face various types of threats, such as unauthorized access to their network and data. Additionally, maintaining an accurate inventory helps organizations to classify their assets into distinct groups according to their criticality and sensitivity for business operations, and to develop policies and procedures for the use of removable media. This ultimately enhances their overall asset management and cybersecurity posture.\n",

With this approach, it is usual for the virus code to be constructed so that the “original” code is executed after the virus code, as indicated in the examples of Figure 5.

Directly changing the AddressOfEntryPoint ﬁeld is such an obvious idea that most an- tivirus systems check whether the beginning of the code is in a section which should not contain executable code or contains known patterns from a database of viral code. In an Entry Point Obscuring (EPO) virus, a more sophisticated technique is adopted in order to hide what is going on. Some possibilities, roughly in order of increasing complexity, are: • Insert a JUMP instruction somewhere in the executable’s code, to cause a jump to the start of the virus code. 6'), Document(metadata={'page': 7, 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/NLP_Project/malware.pdf'}, page_content='imported functions, so that one of the entries in the table is replaced by the address of the start of the virus code. When the infected executable calls the relevant function, it starts the virus code instead. Once again, in order to prevent users becoming suspicious, the virus must call the original function once its own execution is completed. Detection of EPO vira is a challenge, as the inserted or modiﬁed JUMP or CALL instruc- tions can in principle be placed anywhere within the code. Searching through the ﬁle and checking all the JUMP and CALL instructions to see whether they activate viral code can be a slow process. The other eﬀective way to detect the presence of the virus is to emulate the execution of the program and see whether it would actually cause any damaging eﬀects.

It is exactly this problem with EPO vira which has led to the development of antivirus systems which rely on detection of malicious behaviour rather than recognition of signatures. This approach will be dealt with in more detail in Section 6.3 below. A variant of the EPO approach is for the actual viral code to be kept in a library ﬁle (a shared library or a DLL) which the infected executable will call. The changes to the infected ﬁle can in this way be kept to a minimum: a pointer to the malicious library needs to be inserted in the import tables, and a CALL instruction must be inserted somewhere in the executable. This technique is used, for example, by the COK variant (2005) of the BackDoor virus (actually a Trojan horse) which deposits a DLL called spool.dll and then injects code into all processes running on')]\n",

Malware constitutes one of the top threats for network and information systems and the risks associated with its actions may vary: • Password theft, • Data theft, • Identification of additional targets within the network, • Unauthorized modification and encryption of data. Malicious code can infect systems in a variety of attack vectors, including email, malicious websites, and removable media (USB, external hard drives). Its propagation is based on vulnerabilities in the target systems but also on careless behavior of the end user, such as opening attachments and web links, installing software and inserting infected USB on PCs.

They achieve this by manipulating the system's kernel, device drivers, and other low-level components to conceal their malicious activities. Rootkits can hide the presence of malware, making it difficult for security software to detect and remove it. They can also manipulate system logs, network traffic, and other data to cover their tracks and maintain control over the infected system. Additionally, rootkits can be used to disable security features, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, and to prevent system administrators from detecting the malware. Rootkits can be installed using various methods, including exploiting vulnerabilities in software, social engineering, and physical access to the system.

      "The risks associated with using default credentials include the potential for unauthorized access to systems and data, as well as the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks. Organizations can mitigate these risks by modifying the default credentials of every asset that contains default credentials, such as routers, during the first installation. This measure is recommended by the Center for Internet Security Benchmarks. Additionally, it is recommended to ensure that users who perform non-administrative tasks only have non-privileged accounts, which can help prevent unauthorized access to systems and data. This can be done by granting only a non-privileged account to users who perform exclusively non-administrative tasks, such as using word processing software, web browsing, and sending emails. By taking these measures, organizations can reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches.\n",
